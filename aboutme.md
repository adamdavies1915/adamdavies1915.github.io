### Hello, I'm Adam Davies

I'm a full stack software engineer based in New Orleans with over 8 years of experience building scalable systems across fintech, insurtech, and hospitality tech sectors. **I'm currently available for new opportunities.**

### Professional Background

I work with Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, and React, creating solutions for complex technical challenges. My recent projects include:

- Designing a reusable rules engine that reduced implementation time from weeks to days
- Building renewal platforms for commercial insurance that achieved 90%+ policy retention
- Developing point-of-sale integrations that secured multi-year client contracts

My experience spans Valstro, Ki Insurance, PepperHQ, and Morgan Stanley, giving me perspective on both startup environments and enterprise systems.

### Community Involvement

I serve on the board of Bike Easy, a New Orleans advocacy group promoting sustainable transportation and safer streets. My interest in community impact drives my work both professionally and personally.

### Looking for New Opportunities

I'm currently available for roles where I can apply my technical expertise to create meaningful impact. [View my CV](/assets/AdamDaviesCV.pdf) or reach out to discuss how I might contribute to your team.

### Current Projects

I'm developing a side project using Flutter, NodeJS, and MongoDB focused on improving cycling infrastructure. It combines my technical skills with my passion for creating more livable cities.

### Outside of Work

When not coding, you'll find me cycling around New Orleans, kayaking the bayous, or running distance. I've spent three years working remotely while traveling throughout Europe. You'll usually find me abroad during the summer avoiding the hot New Orleans summers.

### Education

BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Bath, UK (2017)
