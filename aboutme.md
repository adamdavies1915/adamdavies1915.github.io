### Hello, I'm Adam Davies

I'm a full stack software engineer based in New Orleans with over 8 years of experience building scalable systems across fintech, insurtech, and hospitality tech sectors.

### Professional Background

I currently work with technologies including Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, and React, focusing on creating elegant solutions to complex problems. My recent work includes:

- Designing a reusable rules engine that reduced implementation time from weeks to days
- Building renewal platforms for commercial insurance that achieved 90%+ policy retention
- Developing point-of-sale integrations that secured multi-year client relationships

Previously, I've worked at Valstro, Ki Insurance, PepperHQ, and Morgan Stanley, gaining experience in both startup environments and enterprise systems.

### Community Involvement

I serve on the board of Bike Easy, a New Orleans advocacy group promoting sustainable transportation and safer streets. My interest in community impact drives my work both professionally and personally.

### Current Projects

I'm developing a side project using Flutter, NodeJS, and MongoDB focused on improving cycling infrastructure. It combines my technical skills with my passion for creating more livable cities.

### Outside of Work

When not coding, you'll find me cycling around New Orleans, kayaking the bayous, or running distance. I've spent three years working remotely while traveling throughout Europe.

### Education

BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Bath, UK (2017)
