Experienced full stack software engineer with 8+ years building scalable, production-ready systems across fintech, insurtech, and hospitality tech sectors. Specialized in Java and Node.js backends and React frontends with a proven track record of delivering both critical infrastructure and innovative features.

Currently based in New Orleans, Louisiana, I embrace modern development practices including LLM-assisted workflows while maintaining strong manual coding expertise. I thrive in collaborative agile environments, adept at translating complex requirements into elegant technical solutions.

My experience spans from building regulatory compliance systems at Morgan Stanley and Valstro, to developing insurance underwriting platforms at Ki Insurance, and creating digital ordering solutions at PepperHQ. I have a particular passion for backend architecture, API design, and creating systems that scale.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me cycling through New Orleans, kayaking the bayous, or planning my next adventure. I'm also a board member of Bike Easy, a local bicycle advocacy group promoting sustainable transportation and safer streets in our community.
